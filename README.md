## _PacMan Exercise_  
PacMan Exercise was basically an exercise to get the PacMan to move back and forth on the webpage screen with its mouth opening and closing once you click the head. Once it hits the edge of the screen, its function is to reverse to the other side of the screen.

# Description: 

The project is for the MIT bootcamp and one of their assignments for us to better develop our JavaScript skills especially with if statements. 

# Installation: 

First you want to download this repo with all of the images and html file and then examine the code. 
You will want to look at the `setTimeout` section if you want to change the speed of the PacMan. 

You can also change the direction of PacMan with the `checkPageBounds function` . 

Once you alter the code, click the image of the PacMan in order to get it moving.

# Roadmap: 

I might want to create a maze out of it once I gain more insight on how to code better.
